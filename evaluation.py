# TODO
# Plot loss as function of #iters; train loss/val loss? both?
# Errors:
# a. Hamming loss (normalized). For each data, compute Hamming loss and normalize by the seq length.
#    Overall, take average on full test set
# b  0-1 loss. For each data, take 0 only if all variables are predicted correctly. 1 otherwise.
# Time:
# a. Inference time
# b. Training time
